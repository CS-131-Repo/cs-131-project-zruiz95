# CS-131-Project

CS 131 Git Hub Project page at Pierce College. This page is being adminstrated by Alejandro Zamora. If you need to be added as a colloabroator please email me, message me on Canvas, Discord (zruiz95) or add you email to the Discussions set up by Professor Yuen.

Info
My understanding of this project is to study a specific intrest related to this course, apply that priciple to solve a problem, then present. We can use this page to upload our work. In order to keep things organized I would suggest creating your own folder for a specific topic and working with others in that directory(folder) if you want to work on that topic. I invite anyone who has worked with github before to assist if you know best practices when it comes to colaboration.
